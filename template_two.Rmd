# Introduction

Welcome to `posterdown` ! This is my attempt to provide a semi-smooth workflow for those who wish to take their R Markdown skills to the conference world. Most features from R Markdown are available in this package such as Markdown section notation, figure captioning, and even citations like this one [@R-rmarkdown]. The rest of this example poster will show how you can insert typical conference poster features into your own document. 

## Objectives

1. Easy to use reproducible poster design. 
2. Integration with R Markdown.
3. Easy transition from `posterdown` to `pagedown` report or manuscript documents [@R-pagedown].

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calculated. In `posterdown` this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical R Markdown formatting.
